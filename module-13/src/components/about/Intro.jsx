        <h4>I design things that people use</h4>
        <p>
          I live and breathe all things digital. Currently, I head up the digital design process at Jan Kelley and play a big part in improving all user experiences across the agency. I began my career in Scotland working in traditional design shops before learning web development, and, more importantly, learning a love for a new level of creativity and experimentation. From that moment on I was hooked on everything online.
